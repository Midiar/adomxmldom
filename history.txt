20060707
Using Thomas Mueller's tweaking for Xdom 3.2 and D2006.
Renamed the files to reflect Xdom 3.2, and to get different
packages for D6 and D2006 (had only D6 package before).

20051120:
Added OnOx31XPathLookupNamespaceURI, allowing processing of
the OnLookupNamespaceURI event for XPath in XDOM 3.1.27.
The event gives the context node as an IDomNode parameter.

20051019:
Made corrections to accommodate changes up to XDOM 3.1.26.
XDOM had changed the way a lot of objects should be handled.
See the history list for XDOM itself.

20050415:
Made Tox31DOMXPathNamespace.get_namespaceURI overridden.
Ran against XDOM 3.1.17, with some unit tests involving the
wrapper.

20041101:
Finished for Delphi 6.
