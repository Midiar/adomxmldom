
Wrapper for XDOM 3.1 through IXmlDocument.
Copyright (c) GITEK AS, www.gitek.no

20051120:
Added OnOx31XPathLookupNamespaceURI, allowing processing of
the OnLookupNamespaceURI event for XPath in XDOM 3.1.27.
The event gives the context node as an IDomNode parameter.

20051019:
Made corrections to accommodate changes up to XDOM 3.1.26.
XDOM had changed the way a lot of objects should be handled.
See the history list for XDOM itself.

20050415:
Made Tox31DOMXPathNamespace.get_namespaceURI overridden.
Ran against XDOM 3.1.17, with some unit tests involving the
wrapper.

20041101:
Finished for Delphi 6.
